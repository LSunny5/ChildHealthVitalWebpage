			<h2> Growth Page </h2>
			<p class="tab">Welcome to the Growth Page!  This page will direct you to some resources that will show you the growth chart of your child.  Males and females have different standards as well as those children that are breastfed and not.  Pediatricians will generally use these curves to see if the child meets the average.  The height, weight, and head circumference is usually taken and plotted against children on the same age.  Whenever a child alters from their growth course, sometimes caretakers can assume that there may be some other issues such as an illness or even just plain teething.
			</p>
			<p class="tab">If a child falls below the curve, they are usually classified as "Failure to thrive" which means that the child has had insufficient weight gain and/or weight loss.  This is more of an issue in the beginning three months of life especially for those who breast feed.  Breast feeders are known to be somewhat lower in weight than those of formula fed.  If a baby has growth issues from breastfeeding there may be other issues such as tongue-tie or not enough milk.  There are many benefits to using the growth chart but it is also important not to rely too heavily as each child differs in their own unique way!
